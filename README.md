=========

Echowaves allows you to take photos from your mobile device and push them quickly to a micro-photo-blog created within the app. Combining the photo-taking utilities of an iPhone or iPad or Android with the accessibility of a Web-based micro-photo-blog, you can quickly create an online album for future access.

Why not Facebook? Because Facebook is all about public sharing. Echowaves is only private.

Why not Twitter? Twitter is trying to be everything for everyone. Echowaves is only photos and Echowaves is only mobile.

Why not Instagram? My phone camera has a better photo editing features than Instagram. Echowaves is only sharing.
