    <h1>Echowaves facts:</h1>
    <h2>Echowaves is not your typical social network:</h2>
    <p>While there are plenty of social networks in existance, we felt
      that non of them does exctly what we want -- so the echowaves was
      born.</p>
    <p>Actually, all of social networks these days try to do everything and, as a
    result, they do not do a specific thing very well.</p>
    <p>We strive to keep echowaves simple, secure and reliable.</p>

    <h2>Echowaves is Micro Photo Blogging:</h2>
    <p>Take pictures with your phone, as many as you want, where ever you
      go, what ever you do -- just keep snapping. We strongly believe --
      it's much easier to snap a picture, than to type a 140
      characters to tell your story.
    </p>
    <h2>Echowaves respects your privacy:</h2>
    <p>We strongly believe that your privacy is what you should be in
      control, not your social network. As such, it's crucial to keep
      things simple from the beginning.</p>
    <p>
      In echowaves nothing happens by default -- if you are sending a
      blending request to other wave -- it must always we confirmed.
      Only when both waves agree to blend -- only then the blending
      relationship will be established.</p>
    <p>Every modern social network sends out tons of email (spam) -- except
      for echowaves. Echowaves does not even asks you for your email
      address when you register a wave -- because we strongly believe,
      that knowing your email address reveils too much personal
      information about you, so we avoid it.</p>

    <h2>Echowaves metaphor:</h2>
    <p>It helps to think about echowaves as a metaphor. This is very
      simple, yet -- very strong metaphor. Here is how the metaphor
      corresponds to the terms you maybe more familier with:</p>
    
    <h3>Account == Wave</h3>
    <h3>Sign in to your account == Tune into wave</h3>
    <h3>Sign out == Tune Out</h3>
    <h3>Stream of messages == EchoWave</h3>
    <h3>Sharing == Blending</h3>
    <h3>Waving == telling your story with pictures taken on your
    iPhone</h3>
    
    <p>
      Echowaves is instant -- there is no quicker way to share a
      photo stream, than to snap a bunch of pictures on your iPhone,
      then switch to echowaves application to have them natuarally
      flow over to your wave.</p>
    
    <p>Over time echowave fades out (just like a real wave, or like
    an echo) -- you can only see 100 last
    pictures in your echowave.</p>

                                             
    <h2>Echowaves is still very young:</h2>
    <p>Echowaves is running in test drive mode -- early adopter's
    feedback is highly appreciated.</p>
    <p>Send your thougts to dmitry@echowaves.com</p>

    <h2>Echowaves has future:</h2>
    <p>Our vision is that echowaves will eventually have only mobile
    phone user inteface -- bear with us...</p>
